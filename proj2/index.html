<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project focused on two things primarily. The first is implementing Bezier Curves and Surfaces, and the other is Triangle Meshes and mesh operations. Compared to the first project, I felt that this was closer to understanding real 3D graphics representation and methods. I was particularly interested in seeing how Bezier surfaces introduced 3D rendering and triangle meshes advanced it further. Through the triangle meshe implementation I appreciated the value of modularity and designing the data structures correctly.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    Bezier curves are curves that cannot be easily represented by traditional interpolation methods. They uses a sequence of control points to interpolate with a parameter t. A single step of the de Casteljau algorithm linearly interpolates the n control points with a given t, to arrive at n-1 control points. This step is repeated with the n-1 points until we get to a single point, which is the point on the curve. This whole process is repeated with different values of t to draw the entire curve. In part 1, I implemented this single step (interpolating n control points with parameter t to arrive at n-1 points).
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    A Bezier surface is similar to a Bezier curve, but it is characterized by n x n control points and parameters (u, v). For each row of the n rows of control points, we first execute the de Casteljau algorithm described in Part 1 (parameterized by u) to arrive at n control points for the next step. We then execute the algorithm again using these n control points (parameterized by v) to arrive at the final point on the actual Bezier surface. The evaluateStep function performed the single Bezier step described in part 1, which was then used in evaluate1D to compute the final point for a single row in the nxn set of control points. The final evaluate function called evaluate1D on each of these sets to arrive at n control points, which then used evaluate1D to arrive at the final surface point.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    For a given vertex, we computer an area-weighted vertex normal as follows. First, we took the halfedge corresponding to the vertex, and initialized a 3D vector to sum the normals of the surrounding triangles. In a do-while loop, we took the twin of the current halfedge, identified the face for that twin, and added the normal of that face to the running normal-sum vector. We advanced the current halfedge to be the next halfedge of the current twin halfedge. We did this until we arrived back at the original halfedge. Finally, we normalize this sum vector and return it.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement the edge-flip operation, we began by drawing a simple 2-triangle mesh, as suggested. Then, we grabbed each of the 9 halfedges present in this mesh, as well as the 4 vertices, 4 edges, and 2 faces. If either of the faces was on the boundary, we returned with no change to the edge. We then re-drew the 2-triangle mesh with the given edge flipped as specified, and re-identified the pointers for each halfedge, vertex, edge, and face (even if there was no change). Finally, we returned the modified edge.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Luckily I managed to implement this nearly correctly the first time. The only issue was that repeated edge flips caused the bottom-right vertex to disappear. I discovered that there was a vertex I neglected to reassign in the code after performing the flip, which solved the problem.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    For the edge split, similar to edge flip we begin by enumerating all of the halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces in the 2-triangle mesh and skipped the operation if it was a boundary. In redrawing the mesh post-split, we have to create a new vertex, 3 new edges, 6 new halfedges, and 2 new faces. We can then reassign the pointers to each of the mesh elements according to the modified drawing and return the new vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement loop-subdivision, I used the suggested 5 step process. <br>
    1. First, we compute the updated vertex positions for the existing vertices, by looping over all vertices in the mesh and using the formula given ((1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum). I added a helper function to compute the original_neighbor_position_sum, which iterated over the neigbors to a given vertex and accumulated their positions. The new positions are saved in the newPosition member of each original vertex. <br>
    2. The next step is to compute the positions for the soon-to-be-added vertices using the formula (3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)). This is done by iterating over all edges in the original mesh, identifying A, B, C, and D vertices for each edge, and setting the edge's newPosition member to this position. <br>
    3. We now split each original edge in the mesh. First, we loop over the original edges in the mesh and save them in a vector (this is to ensure that when we split edges, we only split original edges). We then iterate over this vector and split each edge. The new vertex that is created is marked as New and it's newPosition is set to the edge's newPosition computed in the previous step. We then also indicate each of the 4 new edges created after the split operation as having coming from the original edge or not, using the isNew variable. <br>
    4. The fourth step is to iterate all edges in this new mesh, and if it is a new edge (as marked in the previous step) and connects a new vertex (marked in the previous step) and old vertex, we flip that edge. <br>
    5. Finally, we loop over all vertices in the new mesh and copy the newPosition member into the actual position variable, updating the vertex positions. 

</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>

    In the following steps of loop subdivision, we can see that sharp corners and edges begin to smoothen out and lose the overall shape of the object.
    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr align="left">
          <td>

          <td>

            <figcaption>3 steps</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    In order to alleviate this issue, we can pre-split the edges around the corners, which seems to help maintain some of the shape of the original object.

      <table style="width:100%">

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    The following sequence illustrates the asymmetry that occurs:

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width:100%">

          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="part6/cube/asymmetry/2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            <figcaption>1 step</figcaption>

          <td>

            <figcaption>3 steps</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    The asymmetry occurs at the corners of the object, when different corner vertices have a different number of faces incident upon them. For example, some corners of the cube have 3 incident faces while others have 4 or 5 depending on the orientiation of the diagonal edge on each face. This affects the updated vertex position if we use the weighting scheme described in step 1. To preprocess, I split the diagonal edges on each face such that each corner vertex now has the same degree as the others (6). This ensures that the updated vertex position calculation uses the same weighting factor for all of the vertices. The following sequence illustrates the effect of the preprocessing.
